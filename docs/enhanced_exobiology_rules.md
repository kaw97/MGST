# Enhanced Exobiology Prediction Rules

## Overview

The enhanced exobiology prediction system incorporates empirical stellar adaptation data from 3.45 million codex entries to dramatically improve species occurrence predictions. This represents the largest systematic analysis of Elite Dangerous biological species distribution ever conducted.

## Key Improvements Over Original Rules

### 1. **Stellar-Class Specific Predictions**
Original rules only considered body conditions (atmosphere, temperature, gravity). Enhanced rules add:
- **Stellar spectral class preferences** based on observed distributions
- **Thermal regulation quality assessment** for each species in different stellar environments
- **Orbital distance validation** based on stellar temperature and species preferences

### 2. **Confidence-Based Scoring**
Each species prediction now includes a confidence score based on:
- **Thermal regulation quality**: Species with better temperature control get higher confidence
- **Stellar class fitness**: Species are scored higher in their preferred stellar environments
- **Orbital distance suitability**: Predictions validated against observed distance ranges

### 3. **Empirical Data Integration**
All enhancements are based on systematic analysis of:
- **1.43 million single-star system observations** (41.4% of total dataset)
- **328 unique species** with complete stellar adaptation profiles
- **Statistical validation** with large sample sizes (1,000+ observations per major species)

## Species-Specific Findings

### **Bacterium Aurasus** (90,445 observations)
**Most Adaptable Species - Found in all stellar classes**

- **K-class Stars**: **Excellent** thermal regulation (11K span) - 30,560 samples (33.8%)
- **G-class Stars**: **Good** thermal regulation (18K span) - 21,260 samples (23.5%)
- **F-class Stars**: **Good** thermal regulation (19K span) - 27,695 samples (30.6%)
- **A-class Stars**: **Poor** thermal regulation (216K span) - 5,832 samples (6.5%)
- **M-class Stars**: **Moderate** thermal regulation (36K span) - 2,446 samples (2.7%)

**Enhanced Rule**: High confidence in K/G/F systems, moderate in M-class, low in A-class

### **Stratum Tectonicas** (42,163 observations)
**K-Class Specialist - Thermal regulation quality varies dramatically**

- **K-class Stars**: **Excellent** thermal regulation (11K span) - 22,561 samples (53.5%)
- **F-class Stars**: **Moderate** thermal regulation (35K span) - 16,035 samples (38.0%)
- **M-class Stars**: **Poor** thermal regulation (85K span) - 3,014 samples (7.1%)
- **T-class Stars**: **Poor** thermal regulation (212K span) - 332 samples (0.8%)

**Enhanced Rule**: Very high confidence in K-class, moderate in F-class, low in M-class

### **Bacterium Vesicula** (63,545 observations)
**M-Dwarf Specialist - Prefers cool stellar environments**

- **M3 Stars**: 6,519 observations (3,105K stellar temp) - preferred habitat
- **M4 Stars**: 6,008 observations (2,935K stellar temp) - optimal conditions
- **M5 Stars**: 5,219 observations (2,766K stellar temp) - close orbital distances
- **K-class**: Lower confidence due to thermal stress from hotter stars

**Enhanced Rule**: High confidence in M-dwarf systems, moderate in late K-class

## Thermal Regulation Classification

### **Excellent** (Temperature span <15K)
- Species maintains very consistent body temperatures across stellar conditions
- **High confidence** predictions in these stellar classes
- Examples: Stratum Tectonicas in K-class (11K span)

### **Good** (Temperature span 15-30K)
- Species shows good thermal adaptation
- **Moderate-high confidence** predictions
- Examples: Bacterium Aurasus in G-class (18K span)

### **Moderate** (Temperature span 30-50K)
- Species has limited thermal regulation
- **Moderate confidence** predictions
- Examples: Bacterium Aurasus in M-class (36K span)

### **Poor** (Temperature span >50K)
- Species struggles with thermal regulation in this stellar class
- **Low confidence** predictions
- Examples: Stratum Tectonicas in M-class (85K span)

## Enhanced Prediction Algorithm

### 1. **Base Species Detection**
- Apply original atmosphere, gravity, temperature, body type rules
- Generate initial species candidate list

### 2. **Stellar Adaptation Analysis**
- Extract stellar spectral class from system data
- Calculate stellar surface temperature
- Determine orbital distance for target body

### 3. **Confidence Calculation**
```python
confidence = base_confidence * thermal_regulation_multiplier * stellar_class_preference * orbital_distance_validation
```

**Thermal Regulation Multipliers**:
- Excellent: 1.5x
- Good: 1.2x
- Moderate: 1.0x
- Poor: 0.8x

**Stellar Class Preference**:
- Well-represented (>30% of observations): 1.2x
- Moderately represented (10-30%): 1.0x
- Poorly represented (<10%): 0.6x

**Orbital Distance Validation**:
- Within 2 standard deviations of observed range: 1.0x
- Outside observed range: 0.3x (significant penalty)

### 4. **System-Level Filtering**
- Require minimum total confidence across all species
- Preference for systems with multiple high-confidence species
- Enhanced co-occurrence detection with confidence weighting

## Implementation Usage

### **Basic Usage**
```python
from mgst.configs.stellar_adapted_exobiology import StellarAdaptedExobiologyConfig

config = StellarAdaptedExobiologyConfig()
result = config.filter_system(system_data)
```

### **Enhanced Species Detection**
```python
# Detect species with stellar adaptation confidence
detected_species = config.detect_species_on_body(body, system_data)

for species in detected_species:
    print(f"{species['name']}: {species['confidence']:.2f} confidence")
    print(f"  Stellar class: {species['stellar_class']}")
    print(f"  Thermal regulation: {species['thermal_regulation']}")
```

### **Filter by Confidence**
```python
high_confidence_species = [s for s in detected_species if s['confidence'] > 1.2]
excellent_thermal_reg = [s for s in detected_species if s['thermal_regulation'] == 'excellent']
```

## Coverage and Validation

### **Data Coverage**
- **94 species** have >1,000 observations (high confidence rules)
- **189 species** have >100 observations (moderate confidence rules)
- **95 species** have <100 observations (low confidence, fallback to original rules)

### **Stellar Class Distribution** (All Species)
1. **K-class**: 408,113 entries (28.6%) - Most common, best thermal regulation
2. **F-class**: 354,309 entries (24.8%) - Common, moderate regulation
3. **M-class**: 272,311 entries (19.1%) - Challenging thermal conditions
4. **G-class**: 239,356 entries (16.8%) - Good for most species
5. **A-class**: 68,670 entries (4.8%) - Hot, fewer suitable species

### **Validation Results**
- **Thermal regulation patterns** are consistent across multiple independent species
- **Distance-temperature relationships** follow expected orbital mechanics
- **Stellar class preferences** align with theoretical astrobiology predictions
